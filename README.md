NightShade is a bot using Amazon's Buy Now functionality to automatically refresh a product and purchase it at a specific price
It can help users obtain hard to get GPUs, such as the RTX 3000 and RX 6000 Series

All you need to do is install Java on your system,
available from https://www.java.com/en/download/,
And run the .bat file. You will be prompted for a product URL, and a maxmimum price to buy at
After logging in to Amazon, the bot will turn on and automatically refresh the page until the price goes under the user specified limit
It will then purchase the item and stop.

 This bot is simple, and more features (Hopefully AI assisted captcha solving) are yet to come. Amazon smile links are preffered due to them having less frequent captchas
